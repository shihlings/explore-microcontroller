                                        <p id=1><b>1. Communicating/Collaborating</b></p>
                                        <p>During group projects, communication and collaboration is the key to success. In Social Studies 10, I had a partner during the WWI and WWII Simulation Project. Through exchanging ideas and planning out strategies to attack others between the two of us, we can effectively work out solutions to the current situation. During each class, we also have time to work with our allies to protect our territories from our enemies. This is a great demonstration of communication and collaboration, and without these two skills, the simulation project wouldn’t be so successful.</p>
                                        <hr>
                                        
                                        <p id=2><b>2. Creative Thinking/Critical and Reflective Thinking</b></p>
                                        <p>In English 10, we had the opportunity to learn about Indigenous reserves and the equality issues that still exist now through literature. While we were reading the book, we constantly did reflections and summaries and critically thought about why and how things happened. In the final project, I did a concept map of the novel. Although I’m not talented in arts, I was able to arrange, label, and categorize each event and character in a creative way. I believe this is a great example of both critical and reflective thinking and creative thinking.</p>
                                        <hr>
                                        
                                        <p id=3><b>3. Personal Awareness and Responsibility</b></p>
                                        <p>Over the past 11 months in Canada, I completed more than half of my graduation requirement credits. It was extremely challenging, and at the same time it required high self regulation and motivation. In order to graduate within the timeframe planned, I set goals for myself. For example, I set a goal to complete my Physics 11 online course within 2 months. Each week, I would work on one of the 8 units and take the unit test by the end of next week. This is a demonstration of my personal awareness and responsibility.</p>
                                        <hr>
                                        
                                        <p id=4><b>4. Positive Personal and Cultural Identity</b></p>
                                        <p>As an international student from Taiwan, my cultural background, identity, perspectives, etc. are all different from the other students in the school. However, I do not feel inferior or ashamed of my cultural identity. Instead, I am more than happy to share my experiences and background to my teachers and classmates. This demonstrates my positive personal and cultural identity.</p>
                                        <hr>
                                        
                                        <p id=5><b>5. Social Awareness and Responsibility</b></p>
                                        <p>During my high school career, I have been actively involved in Model United Nations conferences. Each conference, we have a different issue that we want to address and write a resolution for that issue. We often discuss the humanitarian issues happening around the world as well as the wars that have been going on. Besides writing resolutions, debating, and learning about the issues, I also participate in Amnesty International’s Writing Marathon event each year. We write letters and postcards to country leaders around the world, calling on them to respect human rights and resolve the humanitarian crisis occurring in their country. This demonstrates my social awareness and responsibility.</p>

                                        <p id=6><b>6. What are you excited about?</b></p>
                                        <p>I am excited about being able to work on something I love, something I am passionate about, and something I want to do as a career. I am looking forward to exploring more about computer engineering and computer science through the capstone project, and I hope I can create a project that I’ve been wanting for years.</p>

                                        <p id=7><b>7. What are you nervous about?</b></p>
                                        <p>I am nervous about starting to work on electrical kits and programming the items on the breadboard because it is very easy to break them, and this is also the first time I am working on these things. I hope I don’t break anything or fry the board.</p>
                                        <hr>
                                        
                                        <p id=8><b>8. Questions you have</b></p>
                                        <p>I have a lot of questions toward the project I am looking forward to working on, however, things may still change, and it is not for sure I am going to be working on electrical kits. Besides that, I don’t have questions for now. I will ask the teachers when I do.</p>
