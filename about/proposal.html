                                        <p>I chose this topic because I am passionate about computing and I want to take this opportunity to explore how it is like to work as a computer engineer or a computer software engineer. On one hand, I can confirm whether or not I want to consider computer engineering as one of my career pathways because I have never done it before. On the other hand, I can see if I really want to sit in front of a computer and code for 8 hours a day. Now, I only do coding for fun, so there’s no work pressure and I don’t need to look at the screen for that long. So, it would be good for me to know if I like it or not. Besides my exploration and passion in this field, I also want to explore the possibilities of a microcontroller. It is a chip that can perform tasks from lighting up the lights to working with the Internet of Things (IoT), which can be very useful and powerful. Overall, this project is a combination of my passion, personal interest, and also the exploration of the possibilities of a microcontroller.</p>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Subject Areas:</li>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Computer Science and Mathematics: Coding requires high math proficiency in order to understand the numbers and how to convert deca or binary or hex numbers. On the other hand, math is critical when debugging because the logic and calculation must be done by the human brain when the software is not working.</li>
                                                <li>Physics: Physical Computing requires the understanding of electromagnetics covered in Physics in order to understand how to place resistors and connect different wires.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <li>Core Competencies:</li>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Critical and Reflective Thinking: During the debugging process of coding, critical thinking is important because you need to understand what is wrong and how to fix it. It may be corruption of code, memory leak, or syntax errors. Sometimes, you need to draw conclusions from the debugging log and determine whether the software is running properly or not.</li>
                                                <li>Creative Thinking: Microcontrollers exist everywhere, from digital thermometers to ovens to cars. There are infinite possibilities of what a microcontroller can do, but it is up to the designer and engineer to decide what they want the microcontroller to do. So, creative thinking is important when it comes to what the goal of the microcontroller is.</li>
                                                <li>Collaborating: Collaboration is important when debugging is stuck or the software is not working. Sometimes, it is hard to get out of your own logic and think another way. So, collaborating with anyone that has prior knowledge to programming or computer logic would help in debugging. Usually, other people are able to spot the loop holes in your code.</li>
                                                <li>Communicating: Although communication is not going to be a main part of this project, the communication between me and my mentor will be critical to the success of this project. The communication will be helpful when the debugging is stuck, or when I simply got stuck with an error. Also, communication will be the major way of presenting this project to those in interest.</li>
                                                <li>Personal Awareness & Responsibility: As this project would be a self-paced project, there will be no individual deadlines, only a major deadline. Personal awareness & responsibility would be important to keep track of the progress and work on the project while keeping up with other schoolwork.</li>
                                                <li>Social Responsibility and Positive Personal & Cultural Identity: As microcontrollers have unlimited possibilities in terms of what it can do, it is important to know about how you can contribute to society and how this chip can improve people’s lives. Personal identity would be critical to having the confidence of how this project can be beneficial to others and how it can represent one’s core values. Social responsibility would be important to understand the society’s needs and trying to meet those needs.</li>

                                        <p>I would say this is both a passion project and an individual inquiry project. On one hand, this is a passion project because it is something I am extremely passionate about, and I would want to be doing this for a career or as a hobby if not a career. On the other hand, this is an individual inquiry project because it explores the possibilities of what a microcontroller can do. Nowadays, most electronics have some kind of microcontroller embedded, but it is not programmable or requires hacking in order to program. With this project, I can explore how it is possible to create different electronics through experiments and draw conclusions. In the end, I will have a good idea of how powerful a microcontroller can be.</p>

                                        <p>Before starting everything, I will be assembling the parts and connecting them to the breadboard, which is the physical computing component. Then, I’ll start doing experiments on what each device can do and how to program them. After the experiments, I will start diving into combining the devices and create multiple projects and programs that can be used in reality. Also, I would be using a book (Get started with MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico) as reference for the entire project.</p>
