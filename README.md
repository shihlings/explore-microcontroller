Once verified and validated, create a pull request to 'gh-pages' and push. The website will be published automatically once pushed to 'gh-pages'.

### Branch Protetion
'gh-pages' and 'staging' are protected and cannot be deleted.

After a somewhat extended break from HTML5 UP (to work on a secret-ish new project --
more on that later!) I'm back with a brand new design: Solid State, a slick new multi-
pager that combines some of the ideas I've played with over at Pixelarity with an "angular"
sort of look. Hope you dig it :)
