                                        <p><b>November 5th, 2021</b></p>
                                        <p>Over the past few weeks, I have completed the investigation on all of the devices, including the onboard LED Light.</p>
                                        <p>During the assembly stage, I've discovered the problem of signal bouncing and fixed it before doing the tests. <a href="../issues/signal_bounce.html">Click here for details about the signal bouncing issue.</a></p>
                                        <p>Overall, the devices all worked as expected, and I have a rough idea of what I want to do on my final project. The hardest of all the devices probably is the Potentiometer. The Potentiometer is somewhat complicated because the signal must be processed by ADC.</p>
                                        <p>After I have confirmed what I want to do for my final project, I will decide if the hardware design of the board needs to be revised. Then, I'll draw a final sketch of the circuit map and upload it to my portfolio.</p>
                                        <p>Over the next few weeks, I will be working on finalizing the tests and start to work on my final project. On the other hand, I will be working on a Hardware Check program that can be used to ensure all devices are working as expected. I am currently tight on time; therefore, I may be delaying my progress. However, I might be using more time during the Winter Break to catch up with my timeline.</p>
