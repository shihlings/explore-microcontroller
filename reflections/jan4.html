                                        <p>This reflection marks the conclusion of all progress on this project. The next reflection will be my Final Reflection, and everything will be completed in this project.</p>
                                        <p>Over the past few days, I have finished programming and stress testing the security alarm project. It was a pain at first. I had trouble with the PIR sensor again. It triggered action whenever it detected a movement, even when it was not supposed to. I didn't have an actual "solution" to this issue. Instead, I "worked around" the problem. I made extra variables to define whether or not it should execute the action, regardless of the sensor data. It was painful, and it took me a few days to work it out. I've recorded the videos for the traffic lights and the security alarm demonstration. I've also finished up the descriptions for the projects.</p>
                                        <p>The extension of winter break helped me a lot with my project. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to finish up my third final product by the end of the winter break. In that case, I will have to bring my project to school to work on. However, the West Coast is raining most of the time, making bringing electronics to school a hard task. In addition, my board is too long to fit into my locker, which makes things even harder. With winter break extended, I used the extra time to finish up the final bits. Now, I only have the reflections and portfolio stuff to finish up.</p>
                                        <p>Over the next week, I will finalize my portfolio and write the Final Reflection. Then, I should be all set for my presentation.</p>
