                                        <p><b>January 4th, 2022</b></p>
                                        <p>This reflection marks the conclusion of this project.</p>
                                        <p>Over the past 110 days, I went from nothing to three fully functional products, along with nine device experiments. I wrote more than 15 source files and approximately 1500 lines of code. It has been a long process, and now I'm at the end of the project.</p>
                                        <p>To me, this project is a huge milestone. I had to work on something that did not come in a kit. With no tutorials and instructions along the way, I had to look at datasheets and figure out how each device communicates with each other and make things work. Seeing this project coming to an end is just astounding. This project may not directly impact the school or community-at-large, but the products that can be made out of this project can be beneficial to the whole society. The <a href="../final/security_alarm.html">Security Alarm</a> project is just a perfect example. With low-cost materials, people can get a small alarm for security purposes. Of course, to be used in regular households, the product still needs to be altered in different ways and suit the customers' needs, but the idea is there.</p>
                                        <p>Reflecting on what I have done over the past few months, I have shown my proficiency in Physics, Computer Science, and Mathematics. The <a href="../hardware/circuit.html">Circuit Diagram</a> I've drawn is a perfect demonstration of that. The timing and variable counts all rely on the mathematics to work, and I've applied what I have learned in my academic classes to resolve issues.</p>
                                        <p>Besides the academic skillsets, I've also demonstrated the core competencies listed in <a href="../about/proposal.html">my proposal</a>. My reflections demonstrated how I am applying reflective thinking during my Capstone Project. I do bi-weekly reflections on what I have done, what I have encountered, and what I need to finish before my next reflection. I was once behind on my scheduled timeline, and I knew that I needed to make time to catch up on my progress, or I wouldn't be able to finish my project in time. I believe this demonstrates my personal awareness and responsibility, which I am aware that I am in charge of making time and completing the project on my own. However, collaboration is a big part of the career that I want to pursue. When I encounter errors, I debug on my own first. Through critical thinking, I try different bug fixes. When I hit a dead-end, I reach out to my mentors. They are experts that have been in the workforce working on related stuff for years. Although I have been playing around with computers and chips for a few years, my level of understanding is still far away from theirs. Therefore, communication is the key. Through effective communication, I communicated my thoughts with my mentors and came up with solutions without fighting. While I am continuously figuring out these issues, I also had to think of final products for my final Capstone Project demonstration. I demonstrated my creative thinking by coming up with ideas like the <a href="../final/traffic_lights.html">Traffic Lights</a> project and the <a href="../final/security_alarm.html">Security Alarm</a> project. In addition, the <a href="../final/security_alarm.html">Security Alarm</a> project is also a demonstration of my social responsibility and positive personal & cultural identity. We all need to protect ourselves and our properties from unauthorized persons, and the <a href="../final/security_alarm.html">Security Alarm</a> project is to fulfill that need through low-cost materials.</p>
                                        <p>Looking back at the whole project, I am most proud of myself. I can step out of my comfort zone and move from things I am used to working with to something I've never worked with before. There were many difficulties I have faced during the project, and I've resolved them step by step. For instance, the <a href="../issues/lcd_display.html">LCD Display Error</a> issue was one of the worst problems I've encountered. Every time I thought the error was gone, it came back and broke my program. In the end, I found the root cause and addressed it. I almost held a party for just fixing that issue.</p>
                                        <p>If I could redo this project, I'd say that I would like to have more budget and afford some more fancy sensors. With limited sensors and devices, I didn't have a lot of combinations to work with, and my final products couldn't utilize the Raspberry Pi Pico to its fullest potential. I recommend those that want to work on microcontrollers as Capstone Projects in the future to start looking for mentors earlier. I never had the chance to get to know any computer teachers here as I entered Westview as an international student in Q2 2020-2021. I am an introvert, so I prefer to have a mentor that I know. In the end, I asked my sister and my dad, which isn't always the best choice. Furthermore, searching for final product ideas on the internet is the least helpful resource ever. Every project I saw was either too costly, and I didn't have the materials, or it was just a little test that wasn't even a project.</p>
                                        <p>Overall, this project was an amazing experience. It allowed me to explore my interest and make them a reality. I know I am on the right path and the right track to the future career I want, and I hope my passion is and will always stay the same, if not more.</p>
