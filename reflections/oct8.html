                                        <p><b>October 8th, 2021</b></p>
                                        <p>This week marks the official start of the Capstone Project. The proposal and timeline were reviewed by Ms. Orologio, and I have started assembling the parts. I am looking forward to getting started on this project. Currently, I am on top of the deadlines set in my timeline, so I think I am off to a good start.</p>
                                        <p>I received my Pico development package on Sep. 16, 2021. On Sep. 17th, 2021, I started assembling the Pico, breadboard, and other devices that I will use. On Sep. 18, 2021, I had my initial build completed. Everything was a mess. I had to hold the devices in place when I needed to use them. Since it was only a testing build to make sure nothing was broken during transportation, I didn't care too much about the look of it. On Sep. 19, 2021, I added more devices to test to the breadboard. I have made sure that everything was working and stopped my progress on the Pico. However, there are still minor issues that I need to fix.</p>
                                        <p>During the week of Sep. 27, 2027, I finished my proposal and timeline, so I resumed my work on the Pico. I started with locking everything onto a piece of cardboard, which can be seen in the second revision of the design so that it would be easier to work on and looks nicer. During the assembling of the devices, I faced several issues, including poor contact and unstable voltage, so I started working on fixes for it as well. The poor contact issue was resolved in the second revision of the design. Simply swapping out the jumper wires with new jumper wires fixed it. One of the worst issues was the LCD Display problem. At first, I thought it was because the jumper wires were old; however, the issue was still there when I did the second revision of the design. It even got worse when my LED strip turned on. Afterward, I found out that the LED strip causes an unstable voltage, and it draws a lot of current from the Pico. However, this does not affect other devices, except the LCD Display. So, I decided to move the LCD Display's VCC and GND directly to V_BUS and GND on the Pico, so the LCD Display does not share it with other devices. In the end, I finally solved it with my 3rd revision to my design.</p>
                                        <p>Over the next few weeks, I will be working on my experiments on the devices and learning how to program them. My goal is to complete the experiments by the end of October, which will be a very learning-intensive task for me. With all that prepared, I should be all set for getting a final project done by the end of January.</p>
