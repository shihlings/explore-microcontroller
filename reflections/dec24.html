                                        <p><b>December 24th, 2021</b></p>
                                        <p>This is the final reflection before the end of the year. Over the past weeks, I've finished up drawing the circuit diagram. It was a painful process, to be honest. I had never drawn any circuit diagrams before, so I had to find how to do it digitally. I also had to ensure it had all the templates I needed for my project as I couldn't import any modules to the circuit diagram creator. In the end, I was able to use custom circuitry and finish the circuit diagram as expected. With the circuit diagram completed, I can now reference the circuit diagram when I'm coding. I no longer need to go back to the device and count the breadboard wires, which is a great addition and makes my life much easier.</p>
                                        <p>With the hardware stuff finished, I only have software stuff to deal with now. I'm getting close to the end of this project, and I think I can finish the project by the end of Semester 1. I have completed the traffic lights program and have finished debugging and stress testing. The final task on the list for the traffic lights program is to record a video of it running and add it to this portfolio, along with some description. Hopefully, this can be done in the first week of the new year.</p>
                                        <p>I'm also planning on doing another small final product, which is a security alarm. Currently, I have all the concepts in mind; however, I will have to find a way to make it happen. It involves running the program on both the Raspberry Pi 4B and the Raspberry Pi Pico. The Raspberry Pi 4B currently runs Python 3, and the Raspberry Pi Pico runs MicroPython. As they run in different languages, there might be trouble for them to communicate. Hopefully, I will have a solution in the new year.</p>
                                        <p>The project will be put aside for now, and I will be on a winter break. I will pick up where I left off in the new year.</p>
                                        <p>My goal in the new year is to complete the traffic lights program and the security alarm program, which will conclude this Capstone Project. I aim to complete everything, including the final reflection, by January 16th. Then, in the third week of January, I will be preparing my presentation and scheduling the presentation anytime that week.</p>
