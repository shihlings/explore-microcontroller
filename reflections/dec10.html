                                        <p><b>December 10th, 2021</b></p>
                                        <p>There hasn't been much progress since the last reflection.</p>
                                        <p>For the circuit diagram part, I finally started drawing it. I planned to do it digitally and make it printable into a PCB. However, I couldn't find a program that had every device including the Raspberry Pi Pico on it. Therefore, I decided to draw it by hand. It wouldn't be as good as a digital one, but it would provide a better view of how I wired my devices onto the breadboard. For now, I have completed the individual symbols for the circuit diagram. I only need to put them together, and I am done with the circuit diagram portion of the project.</p>
                                        <p>Besides the hardware check program I mentioned in the last reflection, I've also made a traffic light simulation using the LED Lights, the LED Strip, and the buttons. It is mostly completed; however, I haven't finished debugging and stress testing. I hope I can finish it by Christmas and I'll do another one or two small projects for the final project section.</p>
                                        <p>As the end of the first semester nears, I am starting to wrap up the project. To be honest, this project can go on forever as there are tons of possibilities. Considering that I don't have a big budget and most stuff would be for development purposes, I wouldn't be buying more fancy sensors and motors to build a robot.</p>
                                        <p>During the winter break, I still plan on having more progress. My goal is to complete the circuit diagram and all final products. Then, I can have the rest of the CLC classes to finish my Capstone Portfolio and prepare for my presentation. With that said, if I don't complete them by January, I will still have some classes to finish up as the backup plan.</p>
